# Application

## Small API application created solely to use as a base for `Automation` framework API tests.

### Requires MSSQL instance running. First provide server and user credentials to MSSQL server in `appsettings.json` files in both projects, then run `Application.Database` project to create database on already existing MSSQL instance. After that run `Application.API` project to start API service.
